# TicTacToe

Created a Tic Tac Toe game application in android studio using Kotlin and XML.

<h1> Application Overview </h1>

- I gave it a custom icon which is relavent to the game, to make it convinient for the user to locate the app.

- When the users clicks on the application, the app opens with a "Start New Game", which leads them to the main page where they can play the game.

 - The main page:
   - Displays a text on the top of the screen which tells whose turn is it, the winner and when the game is a draw. 
   - The buttons are automatically disabled once the a player has won.
   - There is a button present at the bottom of the screen which is used to reset the game.
